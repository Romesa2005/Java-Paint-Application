This project is a painting application developed in Java using JavaFX. It was created by a team of students following Agile software development practices, specifically Scrum. Through iterative development cycles, daily stand-ups, and consistent collaboration, the team delivered a user-friendly and feature-rich painting tool.

The application allows users to draw various shapes, such as circles, rectangles, squiggles, and polylines, and provides functionality for saving and loading artwork. It also includes an undo/redo system to allow users to experiment freely with their designs. The graphical user interface is designed with JavaFX to offer an intuitive and responsive user experience.

A unique aspect of this project is the integration of AI capabilities through LLaMA3. This addition enhances the functionality of the application by providing features like intelligent shape suggestions and potentially even guided tutorials or auto-labeling. The AI integration aims to elevate the creative experience and make the tool more dynamic and helpful.

To ensure a clean and maintainable codebase, several design patterns were employed throughout the project. The Visitor pattern was used to perform operations across different shape types without modifying their core structure. The Command pattern was implemented to encapsulate drawing actions, enabling the undo/redo system. The Factory pattern helped modularize and simplify the creation of different shape objects.

Overall, this JavaFX painting program serves as a demonstration of effective team collaboration, strong software design principles, and the thoughtful integration of artificial intelligence to enhance user interaction.
