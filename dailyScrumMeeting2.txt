	Obstacles I face:

Oct 20,2024
	What I did yesterday:
	What I will do today: I did BUG1.001. I was busy the last few days, and my team members finished
	                      the rest of the work. I will try to be more active in working on this
	                      assignment.
	Obstacles I face:   Understanding how to construct image file paths and accessing images. Also almost
	                    messed up and rewrote everything on the master branch. We were okay though!

Oct 21,2024
	What I did yesterday: Understood the code, UML, and BUG1.001
	What I will do today: Take a look at BUG.003 and brainstorm ideas.

Oct 24,2024
	What I did yesterday: Economics
	What I will do today: Finish BUG.003.
	Obstacles I face: Not finish BUG.003. I kept running into problems as I tried implementing an idea, then I would
	                  step away to improve it or think of something new. Then I would have a lightbulb moment, and with
	                  full confidence, attempt to implement it. Only for some other error.

Oct 25,2024

Oct 27,2024
	What I did yesterday: The test and caught up with sleep.
	What I will do today: Finish BUG.003 for real and update architecture.txt accordingly.
	Obstacles I face: Fixing the errors. Actually, after hours of debugging, I went ahead and overwrote my code with an
	                  older version out of frustration, then re-refactored.
	                  I completed BUG.003, but the merge failed. The commit ID is
                          880ac1b22993e322b22d602e4592862966a3395b.
